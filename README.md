Fire up a java webapp in under 10 minutes with webjar-http.

The webjar-http library is a simple but not simplistic java library for getting a REST-based webapp up and running quickly and easily. 
It was initially a part of a larger blog project from which it was distilled to seperate the application concerns from those of the
server running the application. It knits together solid libraries in the java ecosystem to break the entry barriers to web development.

I will demonstrate here how to make use of the library from where you can build on more functionality.
